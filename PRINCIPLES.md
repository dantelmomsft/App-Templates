Below are the guiding principles for an apptemplate

- A developer can deploy a working sample solution to Azure within 30 minutes (This may vary depending on the service used, for ex. APIM or Redis Cache provisioning may take longer time > 30 minutes) 

- Encapsulate proven practices. The simplest demo apps won’t conform to enterprise scale guidelines that require additional infra etc. However deployment to LZAs should as much as possible or incorporating the best reference architecture guidance can help. 

- Simplicity – sample includes MVP with a path to production level 

- Initial scope: green field 

- Minimalism – minimal level of code in samples 

- Extensibility – guidance included on how to customize and extend 

- Observability – e.g., App Insights integration
